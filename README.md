<h1>Duplex - League of Legends Task Completion Web App</h1>
    <p>This is a web application built with ASP.NET that allows administrators to host events and set a price to enter. Regular users have 5 different roles (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond) and a default role of Member. Every user can claim a daily reward, based on their current role. The higher the rank, the more coins they get daily. Every user can join an event and try to complete it. They have to verify that the game account they are using is actually theirs by changing their League of Legends icon to the one specified in the app. After verification, they can complete events and double their entry coins. To check if the task is completed, the app uses Riot Games' API to access their match history and validate whether they have completed the task or not. The app allows them to choose their League of Legends region. The web app has prizes, which only administrators can create, and every user can claim if they have enough coins to redeem.</p>
